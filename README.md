### Serialization, Basic Client-Server Programming, ServerSocket, Socket

This week's task was to create a simple program which is able to serialize ojects into streams and send it over the network from a client
to the server. On the server side the received objects must be deserialized and based using instanceOf I had to decide if the received object
is a command or data.

The server is handling a data file as well, where the incoming object is being stored if it's not a command.
